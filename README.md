# ChatApp
## How it works
This website is called ANY1 where anyone can be whoever they want. If the user isn't created yet, the service creates a new user for you.
Your identity is bound to your token. If you remove your token, you'll be redirected to pick your username again.

## How to get started
In order to get it running you'll need to have docker and MongoDB installed with the latest update and do the following:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run npm install
3. Run Docker compose up --build
4. Open your web browser and navigate to localhost:3000
5. Pick a name and go

## How to fully test it
In order to get the most out of it, it's recommended to have two browsers open. One in normal mode and one in incognito. This gives you the
possibility to chat with yourself and to fully experience the application. You can also simply remove the token from your local storage and
you'll be redirected to pick another name.
